	<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
	<h2>Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
	<p>The results from the Myers-Briggs test showed that my personality type was a defender or an ISFJ. 
		These test results mean that I am very kind, loyal and considerate towards others. This also
		means though that I am a private person with a small friend group. Another characteristic of a 
		defender is that they are organised and plan-ahead. They are also responsible with the time
		management of tasks, by ensuring all tasks are completed on time. All these characteristics 
		describe how I live my life. The results show that my personality type can be both good and
		bad for teamwork. This is the case because, while I ensure all my tasks are completed on time, 
		I am also a private person which can mean I will sometimes be reluctant to speak with other members
		of the group. I am also kind, loyal and considerate which are all good attributes of a good team player.

		<h3>Learning Stlye</h3>
	<p>My learning style test showed me some interesting results that I didnâ€™t know about myself. I learnt
		that I am a tactile learner, which means I am better at remembering and learning new things by 
		not just reading or seeing things, but also doing them myself. Some things mentioned from the test 
		also represent a lot of truth about me. The first being that I am very athletic, and I also have very 
		good hand eye co-ordination. The second being I learn and remember new things by doing them myself, 
		I then keep the information learnt and try to improve upon from what I learnt previously. A tactile 
		learner is also known as a kinaesthetic learner and these types of people are very good in team environments. 
		Kinaesthetic learners are good in team environments because they are willing to take risks that other types 
		of learners are unwilling to make, and this makes them a valuable team member.
