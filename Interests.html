	<h1>Interest in I.T</h1>
	<p>Over the years i have had very little interest in I.T because I didn't really know what role it played in my life
	    but as i got older I started to appreciate it more. My interest in I.T really started when I was 16 years of age.
		It started at this age because this was when I began to realize that I.T plays a major role in my life. I.T allowed
		me to connect to family members in other countries, it lets me connect to my friends using social media and online 
		networks such as the PlayStation network. I have little to no experience in I.T other than playing games. 
		</p>
	<h2>Why I chose RMIT</h2>
	<p>I chose RMIT as my university because it was the only university that offered my degree online. After completing my I.T
	   subject I will expect that I have a basic understanding of how I.T affects everyone around the world, and I also expect that 
	   I will have the basic knowledge to code using html.
