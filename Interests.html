	<h1>Interest in I.T</h1>
	<p>Over the years i have had very little interest in I.T because I didn't really know what role it played in my life
	    but as i got older I started to appreciate it more. My interest in I.T really started when I was 16 years of age.
		It started at this age because this was when I began to realize that I.T plays a major role in my life. I.T allowed
		me to connect to family members in other countries, it lets me connect to my friends using social media and online 
		networks such as the PlayStation network. I have little to no experience in I.T other than playing games. 
		</p>
	<h2>Why I chose RMIT</h2>
	<p>I chose RMIT as my university because it was the only university that offered my degree online. After completing my I.T
	   subject I will expect that I have a basic understanding of how I.T affects everyone around the world, and I also expect that 
	   I will have the basic knowledge to code using html.
	</p>   
	<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
	<p>My ideal job is to become a financial planner, and I am achieving this goal by studying a financial planning degree through RMIT. 
	   This position is appealing to me because of the benefits that come from working in this job. The benefits include a competitive salary 
	   and ongoing support from the company in my personal growth as a financial planner. The job requires several yearsâ€™ experience at being 
	   a financial planner, requires you to have the ability to manage a wide range of different clients while also providing these clients 
	   with the best possible outcome they can achieve. At the current time I have none of these skills because I have just started with my studying. 
	   I plan to obtain these skills by first completing my university degree and then gaining the skills from working in the industry to gain hands on experience with a similar job.
